Easy access to Joomla's log files

This administrator module shows a list of joomla log files and the php error log (if accessible).
This files can be (partialy) viewed, downloaded or deleted. 

##Installation
- [Download the latest version of the plugin](https://github.com/brbrbr/plg_system_extensiontools/releases/latest)
- Install the module using `Upload & Install` (or copy  the link to the zipfile and use `Install from URL`)
- The installation should automaticly add a module in your system dashboard. If not create a new `administrator` module.

Log files can only be viewed by administrators with core admin access.

##Options
Large files can be truncated for viewing. Files larger than `Max size` Kilobytes will only show the last `Max lines` lines.
Downloading always returns the whole file.
