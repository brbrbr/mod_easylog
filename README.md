# Easy Log Module

Easy access to Joomla's log files

This administrator module shows a list of Joomla's log files and the PHP error log (if accessible). Log files can only be viewed and managed by administrators with core admin access. This files can be (partially) viewed, downloaded or deleted.

## Installation
- [Download the latest version of the module](https://github.com/brbrbr/mod_easylog/releases/latest)
- Install the module using Upload & Install` (or copy the link to the zip file and use `Install from URL``)
- The installation should automatically add a module in your system dashboard. If not, create a new `administrator` module. `cpanel-system` is the position for the System panel


## Options
Large files can be truncated for viewing. Files larger than `Max size` Kilobytes will only show the last `Max lines` lines.
Downloading always returns the whole file.
